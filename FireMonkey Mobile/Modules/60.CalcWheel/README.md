# CalcWheel

This is a simple calculator using the FlexCel engine to do the
calculations.

## Concepts

- In this demo we have many dynamic templates that are used to
  calculate different stuff. You can add new templates just by
  copying them to the \"Library\" folder.

- CalcWheel will Show the string in the sheet \"Data\", cell A1, and
  ask for the value of \"Data!B1\". It will then recalculate the
  sheet, and display the value of the cell in \"Result\" A1 and B1.
