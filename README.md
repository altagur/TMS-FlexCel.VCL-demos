## New in v 7.5.1 - April 2020


- **Bug Fix.** With some combinations of Delphi versions and platforms, you could get Access Violations when opening files in FlexCel 7.5. This was caused by a bug in the way Delphi handles method inlining, and it didn't happen in previous FlexCel versions. **If you installed FlexCel 7.5, please update.**
