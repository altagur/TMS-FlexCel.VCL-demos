# Thanks

Last but not least, we would like to thank all the people that
contributed with this project. They are too many to be mentioned here,
because FlexCel is built on the help of many people, but here there are
some:


- People of the Mono project for providing such an amazing
  implementation of the .NET framework.

- People at Juice Analitics for their ideas on \"infographics\" we
  used on the \"VIRTUAL DATASETS\" demo

- Everybody who is mentioned in the file copyright.txt.

- You.

- And everybody else we forgot.
